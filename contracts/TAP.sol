// First four bytes of the SHA3 hash of the function signature are the first four bytes of the
// signed transaction data. Parameter types are split by a single comma with no spaces.
// So to compute this for function bidOnRecord(string recordId) returns (bool success),
// you would use bytes4(sha3("bidOnRecord(string)"))

// Also, should think about signing the attestation using the ethereum address private key
// which can then be verified to establish a link between the author and the attestation.
